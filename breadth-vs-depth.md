# breadth vs depth

in all cases, go for breadth vs depth at the beginning *unless* your curiosity pulls you strongly towards a particular target (word, chapter, concept, etc)

adults learn faster than children for one reason: they have previous knowledge
on which to build new knowledge

children must learn through experimentation and subsequent inductive reasoning as they collapse many examples into a general rule that they can remember over
the long term.

adults also have the experiental advantage that affords abductive reasoning where reasonable guesses are made based on insufficient information.  some people call this "intuition"

## depth first with default sequencing

natural ways of learning simple systems.  the way we were taught to learn typically follows the natural path we take when studying something simple.  

if i've just bought a watch i need to know how to turn it on and set it.  thereafter we just use it since we naturally "understand it".

when we apply this approach to more complex systems, we end up with a suboptimal experience.

consider the following:


### reading a book

most people will handle technical books this way:

- glance at the font cover, noting any positive reviews or "best seller" awards
- skim the back cover to get an idea of what's inside
- open the first page of the book, take a deep breath and start reading
- close the book an hour later and 20 pages in, dreading the fact that it'll take several weeks to get through this 200 page book
- never open the book again, or go back to read the first 20 pages the next time you open the book since it's been so long


alternatively, consider this approach:

- glance at the front cover, note author names
  - review book reviews on amazon (or other) for 5 mins
  - review author bios, other books, current activities for 5 mins each
  - review prelude / preface author bio
- skim table of contents
  - once to get a sense of it's structure in 10 seconds or less
  - a second time to get an idea of the top level topics in 30 seconds or less
  - a third time to get an idea of the details behind each topic in 1 minute or less
- choose the most interesting part of the book *at this moment*
  - turn to the chapter that contains that *most interesting* topic
  - flip quickly through all the pages of that chapter reading only headings and noting any graphs, diagrams or technical notation (equations, code, etc)
  - flip again through all the pages of that chapter stopping only to quickly scan each diagram or technical notation
  - flip again through all the pages of that chapter reading only the first sentence of each paragraph
- zoom in on the pages related to and supporting the *most interesting topic* chosen above
  - read the content at this level carefully only as long as it is envigorating and interesting
- take a 3-5 minute break
- rinse and repeat: start by skimming the table of contents again


the difference should be obvious by now.  the first method is like eating your vegetables, the second method is more like inventing chocolate and cheese fondue to make eating your vegetables fun again.

one of the biggest challenges we face when breaking new ground in our learning is spending sufficient time exposing ourselves to new ideas before we get completely exhausted or lose our overall perspective.

by skimming through a large (5-10) set of books in a matter of days, we don't necessarily seek to remember much of anything specific about what we've read, but we naturally end up with is a very clear idea of where the edges of this new subject are.



### taking a course

we do a lot of the same thing with taking a course as we do with reading a book.  for some reason we tend to believe that the way in which the author, teacher or expert has organized the material is always in the optimal sequencing and clustering for our own learning.

the problem with this assumption is that the best teacher for us is ourselves.  we are the only one who knows what we know, so to speak.  so, if it were possible, we would go and learn a thing then come back and teach ourselves in just the right way.  since we can't do that, if it even occurs to us, we tend to give up and just follow the apparent leader: teacher, author, expert.  

if instead we sought first to become a "naive expert" in our new field of study, then take a step back and spend time studying in a way that is most suitable to us, we would learn more efficiently and effectively.


## breadth first with curiosity based sequencing

this is the natural way we learn complex systems.  when overwhelmed by the impossible variety in a system, we tend to go breadth first, seeking above all else an appealing entry point.

consider the following:


### arriving in a new city

we don't start at the northwest corner and work our way southeast, do we?

we start by scanning lists of restaurants or sites we might be interested in, pick a few to start with and go from there.

we skim over reviews of these sites until we get there then we dig as deeply and completely as we can afford, relishing in the experience and building a feverish enthusiasm for the experience.

### meeting a new person

don't we naturally focus on a general overview and then dig into the most interesting parts of our lives when meeting new people?  how often do we spend time discussing our life stories in chronological order?

nope, we start with what we (or the other person) thinks is most interesting
