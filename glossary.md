# Glossary of Terms

**learning tension**
A friction felt between the comfort of available knowledge and the confusion of facing the unfamiliar. Example: when learning a new language, this is felt in the difference between looking up an unknown term or phrase in a translation book versus elucidating meaning from "natural" language examples (conversant and native-language literary sources). A necessary prerequisite to the activity of learning.

**economies of experimentation / economies of trial and error**
The situational factors which define the resources and boundaries of any experimentation. When conducting any experiment, there always _resources_ in varying degrees of abundance (e.g. time, money, attention stamina). Limited resources pose constraints and constants, whereas more abundant resources offer the ability to introduce variables and run comparative trials.
