Back again. Let’s start writing.

Where to start? Hmm. Begin with the premise.

Better learning. How to design and implement self-driven curricula to accomplish individual learning goals.

Based on a simple, cyclical and recursive model of stages for moving from ignorance to understanding.

I feel a bit rusty on just what these stages were. Sure I have this written down somewhere, but from memory they are:

1. Define a goal in terms of skills/knowledge/understanding.
- Identify primary resources and experts in the topic of choice.
- Flood your brain with information until you achieve a state of confusion.
- Repeat. Define one or more smaller goals (ideally ones that bridge off of existing knowledge).

In this way a tree of learning starts forming. You aim for height and start working, trial-and-error style, on building the branches that will eventually lead there.

What is an example? How could this be applied?

Let’s take law. Here is the story.

## Case study

I am a U.S. citizen of voting age whose life is affected by the law to a much greater degree than I know how it works. I’d like to change that.

> Side thought: defining these goals should also have a _meaning_ component. The learner should be clear on _why_ they are learning this, what will they be able to do or how will they feel when they’ve achieved the desired competencies. Could be as self-gratifying as “satisfying curiosity”, or economically motivated “be able to get a job”. **Must emphasize the fundamentality of meaningful learning**. This is crucial. If the “reward” is clear, then building habit cycles (cue –> routine -> reward) will be that much easier, ideally at every scale.

I want to learn the law because having that knowledge will give me the ability to navigate complicated and important scenarios with greater confidence (e.g. reading a legal document, interacting with lawyers, negotiating a job contract, interacting with police, reading the news, voting).

> Another note: what is the measure of completion? How will I know when this has been achieved? These questions should probably go answered as well.

I will know that I’ve accomplished my learning goals when…

What are the components of this cycle? Goal definition, purpose clarification, measurement description, and then… what? Once the finish gate has been built, how to start the race down a dark, mysterious and often invisible track? What is the best way to catalyze learning that produces tangible effects but while still appreciating the messy, non-linear process that learning is?

> Confusion should be the cue which invokes the search for heuristics.

I like this. Something about this I like. Not sure why. Thinking about habits (currently reading The Power of Habit), the pattern that a learner wants to achieve is one in which they search for the weakness in their understanding (just like the most capable musicians practice to identify their weak points). The flavor of that weakness, the emotion that acts as a signifier for it, is confusion. This feeling, which in most of us is a cue for a routine of mental retreat (“SCARY UNKNOWN LAND! DANGEROUS TO EGO! GET OUT GET OUT!”), which produces the reward of reassurance in our own intelligence/competency (“I don’t really need to know that, it’s not important, I’m doing just fine without it”), should be replaced with a routine of curiosity and the search for a mental toe-hold (which can probably take many forms, some of them: heuristic, pattern, metaphor, relation to existing mental model / knowledge), which will eventually produce a similar reward (reassurance of intelligence/competency, but one which is reflective of our _growth_ capacity, not our _stasis_ capacity).
