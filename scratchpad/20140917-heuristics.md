[day 3 of writing habit]

When searching for the term “heuristic”, the definition shown reads:

> _adjective_ <br>enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves: a “hands-on” or interactive heuristic approach to learning.<br>• Computing proceeding to a solution by trial and error or by rules that are only loosely defined.<br><br> _noun_ <br>a heuristic process or method.<br>• (heuristics) [ usu. treated as sing. ] the study and use of heuristic techniques.

There is another common use of the word, which I would define as:

> _noun_ <br>a guiding statement of truth which derives its utility as an appropriate mechanism for discovering further truths, and may not in itself be absolute or without exceptions

Under this definition, we could say that a statement becomes a heuristic if it meets the following conditions [a rubric for heuristics ?]:

1. Is readily comprehensible to someone familiar with the relevant domain
- Is immediately applicable as a guiding principle for action or  further study and inquiry
- Is generally true (for a given context)
- Resolves into one or more lower-order, more specific or context-dependent heuristics
- Can be derived from a higher-order, more abstract heuristic

Let’s take a positive example. “Always drive on the right side of the road” is a heuristic because:

- it is comprehensible to drivers
- it can be immediately applied towards a beneficial action
- it is generally true (in many countries)
- from it, further heuristics can be derived (e.g. “Pick your own lane on one-way roads”, “Drive on the left side of the road to pass when it is safe to do so”.
- it leads to a higher-order heuristic (i.e. “Always drive on the legally defined side of the road for traffic flowing in your direction of travel”)

This analysis brings up an important feature of heuristics: they often carry with them a definitive **contextual trigger** which signals them into activation. A more complete version of the above heuristic could be written as: “_When in the United States_, always drive on the right side of the road.“

The italicized part (_When in the United States_) is a contextual trigger because it defines the prerequisite condition for this heuristic to go into effect.

I believe that this perspective towards fact-building coalesces well with our natural cognitive structures, which are highly attuned towards pattern recognition and habit-forming input-response-feedback loops.

> A heuristic is a form of utilizing the same input-action-feedback cycle of our brains to model a tree of knowledge which can grow and refine itself over time. The contextual trigger (sensory input) triggers heuristically-guided thought or action (psychosomatic response), which reveals a new environment with new contextual triggers, some of which are caused by, or triggered in response to, the action taken (neural feedback).
