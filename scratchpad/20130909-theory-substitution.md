# Theory Substitution

In response to _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahneman

## Notes

chapter flow:
- start with use case: how does this work in the real world?
- back up with scientific examples
- conclude with limitations, where this approach breaks down

- bring in Daniel Kahneman's ideas about system 1 substituting difficult questions for easy ones 
- anecdote: learning how to drive in new cities while on a road trip - I'd spend a few minutes learning the layout patterns & a few street names instead of trying to "memorize" data or particular routes
- danger: oversimplification can lead to misrepresenting/misunderstanding complex systems - use biking trip as example

## Edits

story is a bit disjointed, should have a clearer flow: present problem, describe gradual recognition of useful patterns of behavior, reflect on the meaning

## On purposeful wandering

In the fall of 2010, I spent two months on a road trip from California to the East Coast and back again. I traveled alone and with a group of close friends. We visited at least a dozen cities, camped out in national and state parks, and explored areas of the vast United States where none of us had ever visited before. At times it was thrilling, at times monotonous, and throughout it was full of opportunities for learning.

If you have ever spent a few days exploring a new city, you will know that one of the challenges (and joys) is getting lost in unknown territory. The layout of streets and neighborhoods, the landmarks and architectural identifiers, the people and sometimes even the dialect are all new to your experience of the world. Maps and guidebooks can provide help, though there is also value to be found in wandering without direction. When you don't know what to expect, everything you find has the chance to surprise you. Surprises have the power to stimulate our sense of awareness and instill memories which cannot be had when we follow a predetermined path.

At times, though, our philosophy of carefree wandering was not helpful. We did actually have to get places, after all. There were six of us traveling together in two cars, and thus people would need to be dropped off, picked up, rallied and transported to this or that event or venue. Wandering is all fine and good until someone is expecting you to show up at a particular place and time.

Within this situational context, there is a **learning tension** between knowing the geography of a place well enough to navigate effectively and the confusion of a new environment where navigational knowledge is only accessible from the exterior (i.e. through maps or the directions of helpful strangers). As the driver, I would be faced with tasks such as "drive to the market to get groceries, then pick up 3 friends from the art museum, then drive to the park downtown for a picnic". Usually we would not have a printed map of the city and so there was no option to bring an informed navigator. The constraints imposed required that I learn how to navigate without the normal and expected aids.

The navigation methodology that I settled into arose out of observations and reflections on the geography of cities and my ability to comprehend them. I noticed that attempting to memorize explicit directions before starting a trip (maps were usually unavailable during the course of a trip) was an ineffective approach. In order to be successful with this approach, I would have to remember the directions, follow them exactly, and there could be no unexpected barriers (such as construction work). Any error or change in either of these domains would render me helpless. Memorized directions, while specific, are brittle when placed under stress.

Faced with this dysfunctional system, I needed to find a better way. Spending time looking at maps, which, by the way, is something that I enjoy doing regardless of the intention, I began to observe _patterns_ of shapes in the streets for a various city. These patterns were much easier for me to recall than specific street names or linear directional instructions. 

For example, briefly studying a map of Boston would reveal several defining shapes of the city: a cluster of tangled streets downtown extending out into several large rectilinear East-West avenues, bordered on the north by a meandering river, with several bridges connecting the two, and on the other side there is a main artery that runs diagonally at a low angle from SE to NW. With this shape-based map in mind, navigating the city became a task which relied more on my ability to identify a rough current position (i.e. where am I and which direction am I heading in) and map that position onto a particular area of my low-resolution mental geography of the city. The names of the streets would be learned through repeated exposure to street signs, and thus were not necessary to spend time memorizing.

With this technique, I was able to provide myself with enough baseline knowledge to get from point A to point B. I would often get "lost" along the way, but it getting back on track was much simpler because I could just re-orient and adjust my heading accordingly. An nice side effect emerged as well: because my focus was dedicated to taking in environmental signals and not to following a predetermined path, I was able to easily build up a mental library of landmarks, signs, and other environmental markers. Over time, these would give my mental map of rough shapes greater resolution and definition. It became beneficial positive feedback loop.

I did not consciously choose this method, although my approach demonstrates the utilization of a powerful mechanism of the brain which Daniel Kahneman calls **substitution** [TODO: George Polya also has a definition, perhaps more accurate]. Substitution can be described as the act of replacing a difficult question with an easier or more readily accessible one. For example, if I were to ask you "will it rain today?", which is an inherently complex question that combines many meteorological factors, you will most likely not stop and consider each of those factors in turn. Instead, you will unconsciously substitute the question with one that has a more readily available answer, such as "what did the report on the morning news say about today's weather" or "what does my smartphone think will happen?". Substitution is a way for our brains to rapidly retrieve intuitive answers to difficult questions. We are so good at it, that we are usually not even aware of its existence or impact on our thinking. Without substitution, we would be paralyzed by any decision with more than a few options [REF: Damasio and emotional intelligence].

Applying the concept of substitution to the previous anecdote about navigation in unexplored territory, there are some interesting findings to be had.
