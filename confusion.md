# Confusion

Or, Learning Pains.

You know what you want to learn. You have a plan. You have researched methods for reaching your goals, and you have whittled down your approach in order to begin by building a foundation from which you can elaborate. You have collected resources and materials, and you know what to focus on and what to ignore.

Now what?

At this point you are ready to engage in some good old-fashioned study. What does this mean to you? If you have spent some time in school (perhaps 12 years or more), you might think that "to study" means to practice one or many "study habits": reading books and highlighting, taking notes, making flash cards, etc. Once you have done this you may continue studying by repeatedly reviewing your collected information until you have built a smooth, friction-free mapping between term and definition, concept and explanation, theory and proof. This is not studying. 

Employing study habits like these will produce the _sensation of progress_, but it does not equate to learning. Learning means understanding, and understanding is much different than funneling information between formats (book, paper, computer, brain, vocalization, etc.). Beware the temptation of bullshit busy work. It will feel good and productive, but it is about as helpful to your learning as drinking nothing but diet soda is to becoming healthy.

We propose that engaging in effective study is something much different. It may involve shuffling information around, but that is not the primary purpose.

What you should be aiming for when you are studying is the sensation of _confusion_.

Let's step back for a second. Why would we advise that you explicitly strive to reach a state of confusion? You probably think of confusion as the antithesis of learning. You may think that being confused is precisely the opposite of learning, and thus should be avoided at all costs. Also, being confused is uncomfortable. It doesn't feel nice. Biologically, our bodies respond to confusion as a threat, as something to avoid and seek cover from. It is a form of stress, and we all know that stress is bad.

Question: what did it feel like before you knew how to walk? Think about that.

You felt confused. If you have another answer, go spend some time with a toddler and take a look at the expression on their face when the fall down over and over again.

Confusion is a stage of learning, and a crucially relevant one. We minimize confusion and placate ourselves with easier and simpler study habits that feel nice but only serve to dilute the learning. If you are interested in concentrated, high-voltage learning that is truly effective and not merely a practice in data shuffling, you must come to realize that confusion is your friend.

We challenge you to take this premise as truth, if only as a premise for a thought experiment. (And this whole book is a thought experiment).

Missing: 

- logical reasoning for why confusion is important (you must not know something before you can know something; the stickiness of knowledge is directly proportional to ratio of an emotional delta (confusion=>realization) over time
- how to create conditions for confusion (projects, meaningful inquiry, diving deep, exploring the edges)
- recognizing confusion, self-awareness, catching yourself, defending against frustration
